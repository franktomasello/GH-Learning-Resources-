# Runbook: Let Only a "Hyper Power User" Group Exceed Copilot Premium Request Allowance (Using Cost Centers + Budgets)

* * *

## Goal

Allow only a specific subset of users ("hyper power users") to use paid premium requests beyond their included allowance, while everyone else is blocked from overages.

> 💡 **Why this matters:** This solves the exact failure mode your customer described: org-level $0 budgets with "Stop usage…" enabled will block overages for everyone in that org, even if you try to allow spend for a smaller group elsewhere. GitHub explicitly calls out that existing budgets don't get overridden, and conflicting "stop usage" budgets can block premium requests.

* * *

## Before You Start

Confirm these items before proceeding:

- ✓ **You're on GitHub Enterprise Cloud (GHEC)** — cost centers are a GHEC feature
- ✓ **You know the list of "hyper power users"** — names/handles
- ✓ **You understand this rule:** every user must be covered by a budget if you want to prevent unlimited paid overages for anyone

* * *

## Recommended Design

_This is the cleanest and easiest setup to operate._ Cost centers allocate premium request spending based on users (which is exactly what you need for a user subset).

| Cost Center A: "Default Users" | Cost Center B: "Hyper Power Users" |
| --- | --- |
| **Budget:** $0 | **Budget:** $X (monthly cap you choose) |
| **Stop usage when limit reached:** ON | **Stop usage:** ON (hard cap) or OFF (alert-only) |
| _→ Blocks paid overages_ | _→ Allows overages up to cap_ |

* * *

## Step 1 — Enable the "Premium Request Paid Usage" Policy

> ⚠️ **Important:** If this policy is disabled, no one can exceed their included allowance (budgets won't help).

### Navigation

```
Profile Picture → Enterprise → AI controls → Copilot (sidebar) → Premium request paid usage
```

### Detailed Steps

1. Top-right on GitHub → click your profile picture
2. Click **Enterprise** (or Enterprises → select the enterprise)
3. Top menu → **AI controls**
4. Left sidebar → **Copilot**
5. Find **Premium request paid usage** → set to **Enabled**
6. _Optional:_ choose "Enabled for specific products" if you only want overages for certain AI tools

* * *

## Step 2 — Remove/Adjust Blocking $0 Budgets

**🔴 This is the part that's breaking your customer today.**

- GitHub's guidance is to **edit or delete budgets** that stop usage for the Premium Request SKU if you want paid usage to work
- GitHub recommends **avoiding overlapping/conflicting budgets** because users can be "unexpectedly blocked"

### Navigation

```
Profile Picture → Enterprise → Billing & Licensing → Budgets and alerts (sidebar)
```

### What to Look For

Review budgets for:

- **Copilot premium requests** and/or **Bundled premium requests**
- **Scope:** Enterprise and Organization (your screenshot shows org-scoped $0 stop budgets)

### Action Required

For each budget that is $0 AND has "Stop usage when budget limit is reached" enabled:

1. Click the budget's **⋯ menu** → **Edit** or **Delete**
2. If you want to keep it for monitoring, **Edit** and turn "Stop usage…" **OFF** (monitor-only)

> ⚠️ **Important:** You cannot change the scope of a budget after creating it — so if you need a cost-center-scoped budget, create a new one.

* * *

## Step 3 — Create Two Cost Centers and Assign Users

### Navigation

```
Enterprise → Billing & Licensing → Cost centers (sidebar) → New cost center
```

### Create the Cost Centers

1. Click **New cost center**
2. Create cost center: **Default users**
3. Create cost center: **Hyper power users**

### Assign Users

- Put **all non-hyper users** in "Default users"
- Put **only the hyper list** in "Hyper power users"

> 💡 **How cost centers work:** Cost centers work by assigning resources (including users) to the cost center.

* * *

## Step 4 — Create Cost-Center-Scoped Budgets

**This is what enforces "only hyper can overspend."**

> 💡 **Recommendation:** GitHub recommends a Bundled premium requests budget for most customers (covers premium requests across tools).

* * *

### 4A) Default Users Budget (Block Overages)

#### Navigation

```
Enterprise → Billing & Licensing → Budgets and alerts → New budget
```

#### Configuration

1. **Budget Type:** Bundled premium requests budget (recommended)
2. **Budget scope:** Cost center → select **Default users**
3. **Budget:** **$0**
4. **Stop usage when budget limit is reached:** ✅ **ON**
5. _(Optional)_ Enable threshold alerts
6. Click **Create budget**

* * *

### 4B) Hyper Power Users Budget (Allow Overages)

Repeat the same steps, but with these differences:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Scope** | Cost center → **Hyper power users** |
| **Budget** | **$X** (your monthly cap) |
| **Stop usage** | **ON** (hard cap) or **OFF** (alert-only) |

* * *

## Step 5 — Verify It's Working

### Verify Budgets Aren't Conflicting

#### Navigation

```
Enterprise → Billing & Licensing → Budgets and alerts
```

#### Confirm

- No leftover org/enterprise $0 stop-usage budgets for premium requests that apply to everyone
- You're not accidentally using both "Copilot premium requests" and "Bundled premium requests" budgets in overlapping ways (GitHub recommends avoiding overlaps)

* * *

### Verify Attribution by Cost Center

To check whether usage is landing in the right bucket, use the **Usage views** and/or a **detailed usage report** (look for cost center columns like `cost_center_name`).

* * *

## Optional: Use a Second Org for Power Users

If the customer's "Enterprise org" exists to raise the included allowance (e.g., Business → Enterprise), GitHub explicitly documents this approach: create a new org, add users, grant Copilot Enterprise to that org.

> 💡 **Use case:** This helps "power users" hit the overage threshold less often, but it does not replace the budget/cost-center setup for "hyper users who must exceed allowance."

* * *

## Notes for Accounts with Legacy $0 Budgets

GitHub notes that accounts created **before Aug 22, 2025** may have an auto-created $0 Copilot premium request budget that rejects overages unless edited/deleted, and that these default $0 budgets are being removed **beginning Dec 2, 2025**.
