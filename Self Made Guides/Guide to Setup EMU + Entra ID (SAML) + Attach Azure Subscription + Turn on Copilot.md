# 🚀 GitHub Enterprise Managed Users (EMU) Setup Guide

> **Complete end-to-end runbook for configuring EMU with Microsoft Entra ID (SAML), Azure billing, and GitHub Copilot**

---

## 📋 Overview

This guide walks through setting up a new GitHub Enterprise Cloud (GHEC) with Enterprise Managed Users (EMU), including:

- ✅ EMU with Microsoft Entra ID (SAML SSO)
- ✅ SCIM provisioning for user lifecycle management
- ✅ Azure subscription attachment for billing
- ✅ GitHub Copilot enablement
- ✅ Organization structure guidance

**Hosting Options:** EMU can be hosted on GitHub.com or (for data residency) on a customer subdomain of GHE.com. Setup is similar, but SAML/SCIM URLs differ.

---

## 0️⃣ Prerequisites Checklist

### ✓ Required Items

Before beginning, ensure you have:

- **EMU Enterprise Created** — A new enterprise with EMU enabled (different from standard enterprise)
- **Setup User** — `SHORTCODE_admin` created by GitHub, with password set and 2FA enabled (store recovery codes securely)
- **Entra Admin Access** — Ability to create Enterprise Apps and configure SAML SSO + SCIM provisioning
- **Azure Subscription** — Subscription ID and someone who can grant tenant-wide admin consent

> **💡 Note:** SCIM provisioning is **required** for EMU to manage user lifecycle and account creation.

---

## 1️⃣ Create & Configure the EMU Setup User

### Process

1. GitHub emails an invite to set the password for `SHORTCODE_admin`
2. In a **private/incognito window**:
   - Set password
   - Enable 2FA
   - Save recovery codes securely

### Important Notes

> **⚠️ Setup User Purpose:** This account is primarily for SCIM provisioning via token and recovery scenarios. Day-to-day enterprise administration should be done with provisioned managed user accounts.

> **🚨 Email Conflict:** If the provided email address is already associated as a primary email with an existing GitHub account, the activation link will not work. Modify the existing account's primary email first.

---

## 2️⃣ Create the Entra ID Enterprise Application

### Navigation Path

```
Microsoft Entra Admin Center
  → Entra ID
    → Enterprise applications
      → + New application
        → Browse Azure AD Gallery
          → Search: "GitHub Enterprise Managed User"
            → Create/Add
```

### SAML Configuration

1. Navigate to **Single sign-on** → Select **SAML**
2. Edit **Basic SAML Configuration**

### SAML Values

#### For GitHub.com Hosted EMU

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Identifier (Entity ID)** | `https://github.com/enterprises/YOUR_ENTERPRISE` |
| **Reply URL (ACS URL)** | `https://github.com/enterprises/YOUR_ENTERPRISE/saml/consume` |
| **Sign-on URL** | `https://github.com/enterprises/YOUR_ENTERPRISE/sso` |

#### For GHE.com Hosted EMU (Data Residency)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Identifier (Entity ID)** | `https://SUBDOMAIN.ghe.com/enterprises/SUBDOMAIN` |
| **Reply URL (ACS URL)** | `https://SUBDOMAIN.ghe.com/enterprises/SUBDOMAIN/saml/consume` |
| **Sign-on URL** | `https://SUBDOMAIN.ghe.com/enterprises/SUBDOMAIN/sso` |

> **⚠️ Critical:** The Identifier format differs from the application's suggested format. Ensure the Identifier **does not** contain a trailing slash.

### Download Required Items

From the Entra Enterprise App:

1. **SAML certificate (Base64)** — Download this file
2. **Login URL** — Copy this value
3. **Microsoft Entra Identifier** — Copy this value

### Assign Users

Navigate to **Users and Groups** and assign one or more users with the **Enterprise Owner** role.

---

## 3️⃣ Enable SAML SSO in GitHub

### Navigation Path

```
GitHub (as SHORTCODE_admin)
  → Profile picture (top-right)
    → Your enterprises
      → Select your enterprise
        → Settings
          → Authentication security
```

### Configuration Steps

1. Locate the **SAML single sign-on** section
2. Check **Require SAML authentication**
3. Enter the following values from Entra:
   - **Sign on URL:** Paste the Login URL from Entra
   - **Issuer:** Paste the Microsoft Entra Identifier
   - **Public certificate:** Paste the contents of the Base64 certificate
4. Click **Save**

> **🔐 Critical:** Before enabling SAML, download and securely store your **enterprise SSO recovery codes**. These are essential for break-glass scenarios if your IdP becomes unavailable.

---

## 4️⃣ Configure SCIM Provisioning

SCIM handles user creation and deactivation in EMU. This requires creating a token in GitHub and configuring provisioning in Entra.

### 4A — Create the SCIM Token in GitHub

The token must be created as the setup user with specific requirements:

**Token Requirements:**
- ✓ Scope: `scim:enterprise`
- ✓ Expiration: No expiration
- ✓ Created by: `SHORTCODE_admin`

#### Creation Steps

```
GitHub (as SHORTCODE_admin)
  → Profile picture
    → Settings
      → Developer settings
        → Personal access tokens
          → Tokens (classic)
            → Generate new token (classic)
```

**Configuration:**
- **Note:** "Entra SCIM Provisioning" (or similar descriptive name)
- **Expiration:** No expiration
- **Scope:** Select `scim:enterprise` only

**🔑 Important:** Copy the token immediately after generation. You won't be able to see it again.

### 4B — Configure Provisioning in Entra

#### Navigation Path

```
Entra Admin Center
  → Entra ID
    → Enterprise applications
      → GitHub Enterprise Managed User
        → Provisioning
```

#### Configuration

1. Set **Provisioning Mode** = **Automatic**
2. Under **Admin Credentials**, enter:
   - **Tenant URL:** (see table below)
   - **Secret Token:** The PAT created in step 4A
3. Click **Test Connection**
4. Click **Save**

#### Tenant URL Values

| Environment | Tenant URL |
|-------------|------------|
| **GitHub.com** | `https://api.github.com/scim/v2/enterprises/YOUR_ENTERPRISE` |
| **GHE.com** | `https://api.SUBDOMAIN.ghe.com/scim/v2/enterprises/SUBDOMAIN` |

### 4C — Configure Attribute Mappings

1. Under **Mappings**, select **Synchronize Microsoft Entra users to GitHub Enterprise Managed User**
2. Review default attribute mappings (typically work for most scenarios)
3. Ensure **Provisioning Status** is set to **On** under Settings

### 4D — Assign Users/Groups for Provisioning

1. Navigate to **Users and groups** in the Enterprise App
2. Assign users and/or groups to the application
3. Entra will SCIM-provision these members into the EMU enterprise

#### Provisioning Notes

> **📌 Important Constraints:**
> - Entra does **not** provision nested groups
> - Provisioning cycle runs approximately every **40 minutes**
> - Use **"Provision on demand"** for immediate provisioning
> - Do not assign more than **1,000 users per hour** to avoid rate limits

> **⚠️ Unsupported Configuration:** The combination of Okta and Entra ID for SSO and SCIM (in either order) is explicitly **not supported** by GitHub.

## 5️⃣ Attach Azure Subscription for Billing

Connect your Azure subscription so GitHub usage (Copilot, Actions, Codespaces, etc.) is billed through Azure.

### Prerequisites

- ✓ Owner of the GitHub enterprise account
- ✓ Azure Subscription ID
- ✓ Azure user who can provide tenant-wide admin consent

### Configuration Steps

#### Navigation Path

```
GitHub
  → Your enterprise (https://github.com/enterprises/YOUR_ENTERPRISE)
    → Billing & licensing
      → Payment information
        → Metered billing via Azure
          → Add Azure Subscription
```

#### Process

1. Click **Add Azure Subscription**
2. Sign in to your Microsoft account
3. Review the **"Permissions requested"** prompt
4. Click **Accept**
5. Select your Azure Subscription ID
6. Check the confirmation box
7. Click **Connect**

> **💡 Admin Consent:** If you don't see a "Permissions requested" prompt and instead see a message about needing admin approval, you may need to configure an admin consent workflow in Azure or work with your Azure AD global administrator.

---

## 6️⃣ Enable GitHub Copilot

### 6A — Enable at Enterprise Level

With Azure billing connected via metered billing, Copilot usage will be billed through your Azure subscription.

#### Navigation Path

```
GitHub Enterprise Settings
  → AI controls (top navigation)
    → Copilot (sidebar)
```

#### Access Management Configuration

Under **Access management**, choose:

- **Disabled** — No organizations can use Copilot
- **All organizations** — Enable for all organizations in the enterprise
- **Specific organizations** — Select which organizations can use Copilot

Select the **Copilot tier** (Business or Enterprise) for each enabled organization.

### 6B — Configure Copilot Policies

1. Navigate to the **Policies** tab under **AI controls → Copilot**
2. Configure policies for:
   - Suggestions matching public code (Allowed/Blocked)
   - Copilot in GitHub.com
   - Copilot Chat in the IDE
   - Copilot in the CLI
   - Other feature policies

#### Policy Options

For each policy, select:
- **Enabled/Allowed** — Feature is on for all organizations
- **Disabled/Blocked** — Feature is off for all organizations
- **No policy** — Delegate decision to organization owners

### 6C — Assign Copilot Seats

After enabling at the enterprise level:

```
Organization Settings
  → Copilot
    → Access
      → Add members or enable for all
```

Organization owners can assign Copilot seats to individual members or teams.

## 7️⃣ Organization Structure Guidance

Organizations are boundaries for ownership, settings, and repository visibility patterns. EMU provides centralized identity and lifecycle management across all organizations.

### Recommended Patterns

#### 📐 Design Principles

**"Few orgs" bias:** Keep organization count low unless you have genuine separation needs:
- Compliance boundaries
- Distinct admin models
- Legal entity separation

#### 🏢 Common Structures

**Org-per-business-unit:**
- Use when autonomy differs
- Separate admins and policies
- Different billing/cost centers

**Org-per-environment:**
- Only if required (e.g., regulated prod code vs everything else)
- Otherwise, teams and repositories are usually sufficient

### Inside an Organization

**Teams:**
- Use **Teams** for repository access control
- Use **Entra groups** for consistent membership (synced via SCIM)
- Start with a small set of "platform" teams:
  - Developers
  - Maintainers
  - Security Champions
  - CI Admins
- Grow organically from there

**Repository Visibility:**
- EMU provides an **Internal** visibility type
- Perfect for InnerSourcing within your enterprise
- Visible to all enterprise members, but not public
